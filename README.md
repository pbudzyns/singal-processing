# Signal Processing

This repository cotains exercises done during a course of signal processing. 

## Guitar Tuner 
Use fast Fourier transformation for perform spectral analysis of audio recordings to determine the frequency of a sound. The goal was to guess which guitar string was played and compute the tone accuracy in cents, taking the theoretical frequency as a point of reference.
## Image Scalling
Scalling images using FFT and comparing the method with other techniques. Subsampling for downscaling and linear interpolation in space domain for upscaling.
## Filters
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filtes for audio filtering. Filtering images with Gradient, Sobel, Averaging and Gaussian filters.
## Noise Spectrum Density
Noise spectrum density estimation and Wiener filtering.
## Sound denoising
Audio denoising using spectral substraction method.
## Wavelets
Image denoising using hard thresholding and soft thresholding in the wavelet domain. Image denoising by translation invariant wavelet transform was discussed.
## Declipping
Image denoising in wavelet domain and audio signal declipping.
